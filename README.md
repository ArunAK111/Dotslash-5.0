## Motivation
The cost of healthcare has been on the rise in this day and age, and your health has been the most valuable asset you own. Eating healthy and having a good sleep schedule is effective for preventing illness, but as people get busier, it has become more difficult to maintain your health. That is why it is essential for people to take dietary supplements. But how do people know what the best supplements are for them? They can ask a doctor, but the doctor might miss some information and excluding procedures or tests, you’ll have to pay an average of $80-$170 across the U.S for a doctor's visit. 

That is why we are introducing **Vital**, an **AI powered recommender for dietary supplements.**

## What it does
Vital uses users' personal physical information including their age, gender, allergies, and a text input where they write how they specifically want to improve their health. After entering those information, the users' information will be used to generate a list of the top recommended dietary supplement to take. This will help users save time, money, and confusion from spending time searching for which supplements to buy. The user will be able to enter new information to get supplement recommendations for different reasons and conditions.
